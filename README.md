# Discord Fix GUI

![Preview](readme/preview.png)

A simple and user-friendly graphical interface for the Discord Fix toolkit — a set of scripts and utilities designed to bypass ISP restrictions and restore access to Discord and other popular services (such as YouTube, Instagram, Telegram) in regions where they are blocked.

> **Note:** This is only a graphical interface for the well-known **Discord Fix** program.  
> You can always download the original Discord Fix and learn more about it [here](https://howdyho.net/windows-software/discord-fix-snova-rabotayushij-diskord-vojs-zvonki)[1].

> **Download 'Discord Fix GUI' for Windows**: [Release v0.1.0](https://github.com/fuderis/discord-fix-gui/raw/main/DiscordFixGUI.zip)


## Features:

* **Easy-to-use interface**: Launch Discord Fix scripts and utilities with just a few clicks.
* **Service selection**: Quickly choose which service to fix (Discord, YouTube, or both).
* **Automatic configuration**: Adapts settings for popular Russian ISPs (MGTS, TTK, Beeline, Rostelecom, etc.).
* **No VPN required**: Only the necessary traffic is routed to bypass restrictions, keeping your connection fast and private.


## How It Works?

* The interface runs the selected Discord Fix scripts in the background.
* It modifies connection and routing settings to bypass ISP-level blocks, restoring full access to Discord and other selected services.
* The GUI does not encrypt all your traffic like a VPN, but only applies targeted fixes for blocked services.


## Installation:

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/fuderis/discord-fix-gui/raw/main/DiscordFixGUI.zip).
* Extract the archive and install application.
* **IMPORTANT!**: Right-click the program shortcut on your desktop → **_Properties_** → **_Compatibility_** → enable "**_Run this program as administrator_**".
  *(Without this, the program will not work properly.)*
* **To add the program to startup:** Press **Win + R**, enter `shell:startup`, and drag the program shortcut into the opened folder.


## Usage:

* Make sure to disable any VPNs or proxies before using Discord Fix GUI for best results.
* Select your ISP from the dropdown menu.
* Click to center button to apply the configuration and run fixes.
* Launch YouTube, Discord or your desired service — it should now work without issues.


## Troubleshooting:

* **If the fix does not work**: Run the program as administrator.
* **If that does not help**: It is possible that *Windows Defender* or another antivirus is blocking the application. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus or adding Discord Fix GUI to the exceptions list.
