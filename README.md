# UI Application Template

This is a starter template for building modern desktop applications using Tauri and Rust. With this template, you can quickly bootstrap a cross-platform UI app that feels native, is lightweight, and leverages the safety and performance of Rust.


## How Does It Work?

* Tauri acts as a bridge between your web-based frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frameworks like React, Svelte, etc.) and a secure, high-performance backend written in Rust.
* The user interface runs in a minimal webview (not a full browser), making the app fast and resource-efficient.
* The backend logic, system access, and heavy computations are handled by Rust, ensuring reliability and speed.


## Key Features:

* **Cross-platform**: Build for Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
* **Secure**: Tauri restricts access to system APIs, reducing the attack surface.
* **Tiny footprint**: Tauri apps are much smaller than Electron apps.
* **Rust-powered**: Get memory safety and performance out of the box.
* **Customizable**: Use any frontend framework you like.


## Why Use This Template?

* **Quick Start**: Skip boilerplate and focus on building features.
* **Modern Stack**: Combine the best of web technologies and native performance.
* **Community Support**: Tauri is open-source and rapidly growing.
